            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head type="sub">The humble Repreſentation and Petition of the Council-General of the Company of <hi>Scotland,</hi> Trading to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica</hi> and the <hi>Indies.</hi>

               <salute>May it pleaſe your Grace, and Right Honourable Eſtates,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is evident by the whole Strain of Three ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Acts of Parliament, together with His Majeſty's Letters Patent under the Great Seal of this Kngdom, in favours of the ſaid Company, That the Wiſdom of the King and Right Honourable Eſtates did intend, that all ſuch Advantages as might ariſe by the eſtabliſhing of ſuch a Company, ſhould be of as univerſally a National Concern as poſſible; And in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, were pleaſed to endow it with large Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and Immunities, ſuteable to the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of an Infant-Company, and the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its Deſigns: And leſt that it ſhould fail
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46239:3"/>in the Execution, for want of a ſufficient Stock to carry on ſuch an Undertaking, all imaginable Parliamentary Encouragement was given to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of all Ranks, Ages and Sexes, both within and without the Kingdom, whether Natives or Foreigners, to become Partners and Adventurers in the Joint-Stock of the ſaid Company, as is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly manifeſt by the 42d. Act of the 5th Seſſion of this current Parliament, ſpecially calculated for that end only.</p>
            <p>Upon the publick Faith of having due Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the enjoyment of theſe unqueſtionable Priviledges and Immunities, as having received their Sanction from His Majeſty, and the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Suffrage of the Great Council of the Nation as aforeſaid, many Perſons of all Ranks and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees were thereby induced to become Adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in the Joint-Stock of our ſaid Company, in ſo much that in a very ſhort time, a much more conſiderable Stock was ſubſcrib'd for within this Kingdom, than was ever before ſo much as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd here upon any Project whatſoever, ſince we were a Nation.</p>
            <p>Being thus entred into a Society, We and our Conſtituents have purſuant to the intentions of the Acts of Parliament and Letters Patent above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd, with much care and trouble, and a great Expenſe of Treaſure, after having ſtruggled with many unexpected Obſtructions and Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſetled a Plantation, by the Name of <hi>Caledonia,</hi> in one of the moſt Healthful, Fruitful, natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impregnable, and every way valuable Places in all <hi>America,</hi> as is univerſally acknowledged by all Perſons of Experience in ſuch Matters, as well as by the General Conſent of ſuch as have been
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46239:3"/>there: And as a manifeſt proof thereof tho' our ſaid Plantation be ſetled moſt ſtrictly in the terms of the Acts of Parliament and Letters patent above-mentioned, yet it has raiſed the Jealouſy of ſome, and Envy of others, of the moſt knowing and conſiderable Trading Nations in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to our and the Nations great Surpriſe, and ineſtimable Loſs, while we were uſing all ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry means, and big with the hopes of riveting that Settlement upon a laſting Foundation, ſuch was the further continued Chain of unexpected Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and moſt unaccountable Mal treatments that we met with, by Proclamations of a very ſtrange Nature, and otherwiſe, that the repeated Misfortunes following thereupon, put us under an indiſpenſible Neceſſity of humbly petitioning His Majeſty for allowing the Parliament to meet at the day appointed in <hi>November</hi> laſt; in full confidence and Expectation of having the moſt natural and cordial Aſſiſtance from thoſe who firſt eſtabliſhed our Company<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and promiſed it Protection; eſpecially ſince all our other Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations have hitherto proved ineffectual: But a meeting of the Eſtates in Parliament at that time not quadrating (it would ſeem) with His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's other Affairs, a very conſiderable Body of the Nobility, Gentry, and Burgeſſes of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, thought fit, in a moſt dutiful and humble manner, by their late Addreſs, to repreſent to His Majeſty, how deeply they were affected with the Nations concern in our Company's repeated Misfortunes, and therefore humbly Petitioned for the ſitting of this Parliament as ſoon as conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently might be. And the King having been moſt graciouſly pleaſed to order the Meeting of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46239:4"/>the Right Honourable Eſtates now in Parliament, We think our ſelves in all duty bound to give His Grace His Majeſty's High Commiſſioner and the Right Honourable the Eſtates, a ſhort and naked Narrative of the ſeveral Obſtructions, and Misfortunes that we have been all along forc'd to grapple with in the proſecution of our Company's Deſigns, to the end that the great Council of the Nation, having a perfect View and full Knowledge of theſe Difficulties which we now Labour under, may be the better able to to judge how to apply a Remedy.</p>
            <p>The firſt attempt for ſtrengthning our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany's Intereſt and Stock was at <hi>London,</hi> where a Subſcription of 300000 <hi>sterl.</hi> was procured in Nine days time, without ſo much as a publick Advertiſement, and many knowing Merchants were ſo far convinc'd of the many Advantages that might probably ariſe from ſuch a Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they ſignified their willingneſs to be concerned for Triple the Sum, if allowed: But not only did the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> by their Addreſs to His Majeſty of the 13th of <hi>December</hi> 1695. and otherways, render that Subſcription ineffectual, but the Houſe of Commons did alſo appoint a Committee, <hi>to examine what Methods were taken for obtaining the Act of Parliament, by which our ſaid Company is eſtabliſhed, who were the Promoters and Adviſers thereof;</hi> and did afterwards impeach the Nominees in the ſaid Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; notwithſtanding the abſolute Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of this Kingdom:</p>
            <p>Yet after all this Diſcouragement, we went on with our Subſcriptions at home, and made our next Effort for ſtrengthning thereof beyond Sea,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46239:4"/>both in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Hamburgh:</hi> In the firſt of which places many eminent Merchants declared their poſitive inclinations to be very conſiderably intereſted with us, and gave ſome ſignal Proofs thereof, till they were made to underſtand by Threatnings and other Inſinuations, that a Higher Power would make them at leaſt very uneaſy, if they perſiſted any further in their Reſolutions of being concerned with our Company.</p>
            <p>And at <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> where we had the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing Hopes of foreign Aſſiſtance, the <hi>Commercii</hi> or Merchant-Company, entred into Contract with our Company's Deputees, to joyn at leaſt 200000 <hi>l. Sterl:</hi> to our Company's Stock; but to our great Aſtoniſhment. His Majeſty of <hi>Great Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> Miniſters there, did, under pretence of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Warrant from the King, put a full ſtop there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, by giving in <hi>A Memorial to the Burgo-Maſters &amp; Gentlemen-Councellours of that City, wholly diſ-owning the Authority of the Acts of Parliament, and Letters Patent above mention'd, and intimating that His Majeſty would regard their entring into Treaties with our Company as an Affront to His Royal Authority, and that he would not fail to reſent it, as having neither Credential Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters nor being any otherways Authoriz'd by His Majeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon notice whereof, we did in all humble Duty Addreſs His Majeſty in <hi>June</hi> 1697, for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of that open and bold Encroachment, upon not only our, but alſo the Nations Rights, in its moſt fundamental Conſtitution, by endeavouring to ſubvert the Independency of its Parliamentary Laws, expreſly contrary to the Law of Nations: All which His Majeſty by His Royal Letter from <hi>Flanders</hi> in <hi>July</hi> 1697, <hi>Promiſed to take into Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as ſoon as he would return into</hi> England, <hi>&amp; that in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46239:5"/>the mean time, His Majeſty would give Orders to His Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters at</hi> Hamburgh, <hi>not to obſtruct our Company in the proſecution of its Trade with the Inhabitants of that City.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the full Confidence of His Majeſty's Royal Promiſe, we thought our ſelves ſecure, and took our Meaſures accordingly, till to our further ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, we found by ſeveral Inſtances, that His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's ſaid Miniſters were as wickedly bent againſt us as ever, and ſtill denying that they had got any ſuch Orders from His Majeſty: whereupon the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors of our Company, did, by their Letter of the 28 of <hi>September</hi> 1697, expoſtulate in the firſt place, with both the then Secretaries of State, about that further Diſ-appointment, but having ſtill no Redreſs the rein, we did in moſt humble and dutiful Manner, by our ſecond Addreſs of the 22d. day of <hi>December</hi> 1697. lay the whole Matter again before His Majeſty; And did likewiſe, at the ſame time, not only humbly Repreſent the Premiſſes to His Majeſty's moſt honourable Privy-Council, together with the train of ill Conſequences that muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarly attend ſuch Treatment, if not prevented by an early Redreſs; but wrote alſo ſeparatly to both the Secretaries of State, and ſuch other Noble Perſons of the Government, as happen'd to be then at <hi>London,</hi> To uſe their Joint-Intereſt, for procuring Juſtice, in a Matter of ſuch Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Concern to the Honour, Intereſt, and Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of the whole Kingdom.</p>
            <p>All the Anſwer we obtain'd, was by a Letter of the 17th. of <hi>January</hi> 1698, from both the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries of State: <hi>That the King ſaid, He had already given Orders to His Reſident at</hi> Hamburgh <hi>in that Matter, conform to His Royal Letter from</hi> Flanders, <hi>in</hi> July 1697, <hi>which was then communicated to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:46239:5"/>
            <p>By which Anſwer, together with what repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Advices we had at the ſame time from <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miniſters there, had ſtill poſitively diſowned their having got any ſuch Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, we were put out of all Hopes of having any Redreſs, until we ſhould have an Oppertunity of laying the whole Matter before a Meeting of the Eſtates of Parliament.</p>
            <p>But in the mean time we proceeded, with all the Strength we had (tho' extremely weakned by the Treatment above-narrated) to make the beſt Preparations we could (conſidering the Scarcity of theſe Years) for fitting out an Equipage of Ships, Men, Proviſions, and other Neceſſaries, for ſettling a Plantation in <hi>America,</hi> in the Terms of the Acts of Parliament, and Letters Patent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mention'd: And its evident by the very Conſtitutions of the Colony, that they were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated more for the general Advantage of the Nation and Poſterity, than for the particular and immediat Benefit of the Adventurers.</p>
            <p>And the Parliament happening to meet the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry next Day after our Ships had ſail'd, we did, by our Humble Petition of the 22d. of <hi>July</hi> 1698, Repreſent to his Grace, His Majeſties then High Commiſſioner, and the Right Honourable Eſtates then aſſembled in Parliament, the Treatment which our Company met with at <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> as aforeſaid, the great Prejudices which we had ſuſtain'd thereby, and the many further In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies and evil Conſequences that muſt neceſſarly have followed thereupon, if, upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Account whatſoever, the Parliament ſhould happen to neglect the taking immediat Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of ſuch Uſage.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:46239:6"/>
            <p>And the Parliament having thereupon, by their Unanimous Addreſs of the 5th. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1698, to His Majeſty, thought fit to manifeſt <hi>their own, and the whole Nations Concern in that Matter, earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entreating, and most aſſuredly expecting, That His Majeſty would, in His Royal Wiſdom, take ſuch Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, as might effectually vindicat the Undoubted Rights and Priviledges of the ſaid Company, and ſupport the Credit and Intereſt thereof;</hi> And the Parliament like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, by the ſame Addreſs, <hi>recommending the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of the ſaid Company to ſome ſpecial Marks of His Majeſties Royal Favour, as that Branch of the Trade of this Kingdom, in which they, and the Nation they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, had a more peculiar Intereſt;</hi> The Court of Directors of our Company were thereby encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd to renew their Application to His Majeſty, with relation to the Memorial given in by His Miniſters to the Senate of <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> (the ſame being ſpecially mention'd in the Parliaments Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs:) And in Conſideration of the Damnages ſuſtain'd by the Company, through Means of that Memorial, the Directors humbly Petition'd, That His Majeſty would be pleaſed, for their Encouragement at that time, as a Gracious Mark of His Royal Favour, to beſtow upon them the two ſmalleſt of the Frigots, then (and to this Hour) lying uſeleſs in <hi>Bruntiſland</hi> Harbour.</p>
            <p>But our Company having no manner of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to either of theſe, and being aſſured by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Letters from <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> That both the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miniſters there, had poſitively denyed their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received any ſuch Orders, as were long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore promiſed, and declared to have been given, with relation to that Memorial, the Court of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors of our Company did, by their Letter of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46239:6"/>the 29th. of <hi>November</hi> 1698, tranſmit Copies of the ſaid Letters to the Viſcount of <hi>Seafield,</hi> then ſole Secretary of State, and entreated his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, to procure ſome ſpeedy and effectual Anſwer from His Majeſty to the Contents of both that Letter, and their former Petition.</p>
            <p>The Secretary, by his Letter of the 13th. of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> 1698, returned for Anſwer, <hi>That he would take the firſt convenient Opportunity he could have, to repreſent that Matter to the King, but that he could not expect to have it for ſome time, becauſe His Majeſty was then very much imployed in the Affairs of His</hi> Engliſh <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We thereupon waited a full Month, in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome further Anſwer, but getting none, our Court of Directors did, by a Letter of the 13th. of <hi>January</hi> 1699, put the Secretary again in mind of our ſaid Petition of the preceeding <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and Letter of the 29th. of <hi>November.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Secretary, by his Letter of the 7th. of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> 1699, ſignified, <hi>That he had preſented our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany's Petition to His Majeſty, and was commanded to let us know, that there being Accounts, that the Ships belonging to the Company were arriv'd upon the Coaſt of</hi> America, <hi>and the particular Deſign not being commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to His Majeſty, He therefore delayed to give any Anſwer, until he ſhould receive certain Information of their Settlement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho' we could not but be ſurpriz'd, to find all our former Addreſſes and Petitions, about Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſuch weighty Concern, as are above-nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, Anſwered, after ſo long Delay, only with a ſeeming Charge, for not having communicated to His Majeſty a thing that was never in the leaſt demanded of us, by either the King, Parliament,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46239:7"/>Privy Council, or Miniſters of State, we being limited to ſettle in the Terms of the Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, as we ſhould be Anſwerable: Yet upon the very firſt Advice we had of our Colony's Settlement in <hi>Caledonia,</hi> we, by our Letters of the 31ſt. of <hi>March,</hi> and 1ſt. of <hi>April</hi> 1699, gave a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry full and dutiful Account thereof to His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and to both the Secretaries of State, together with an Account of the <hi>French</hi> Deſigns thereabouts, and of what Import our ſaid Settlement (if duly protected) might prove to the Intereſt and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of all His Majeſties Dominions, and refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the ſame, together with the Contents of our former Petitions, to His Majeſties Royal Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
            <p>About this time it was, That His Majeſty was pleaſed to call the Preſident of the Seſſion, and the Advocat to Court, to the end (as we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood) that they, jointly with both the Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of State, might, in a Conference with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miniſters, ſatisfy His Majeſty, as to the Legality of our Company's Settlement: Which (by all that ever we could learn) was then (and otherways ſince that time) made clear beyond all manner of Diſpute.</p>
            <p>But while, in the mean time, we were pawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing even our own particular Credits, for ſending the needful Supplies of Ships, Men, Proviſions, Arms, Ammunition, and other Neceſſaries, for ſecuring ſo valuable a Settlement to this Nation, we were aſtoniſhed to have Advice, That, by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from <hi>England,</hi> in <hi>January</hi> 1699, Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had been emitted, in the Months of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> over all His Majeſties Plantations and Territories in <hi>America,</hi> ſtrictly Intercommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46239:7"/>our Colony, under very ſevere Penalties to be inflicted on the Contraveeners of theſe Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, <hi>in regard that His Majeſty</hi> (as theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations narrate) <hi>was unacquainted with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions and Deſigns of the</hi> Scots <hi>ſettling at</hi> Darien.</p>
            <p>As we humbly conſidered theſe Proclamations to be ſuch, as were never before publiſhed in thoſe parts, againſt any other People upon Earth, and of ſo Barbarous a Nature, as we thought, no Good Chriſtians would put in Execution, even againſt Infidels; So finding our ſelves unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably warranted by all Laws Humane and Divine, we perſiſted in our Endeavours for maintaining that Settlement, as hoping, that, through means thereof, this Nation might, in time, have an Opportunity of raiſing it ſelf above the open Contempt, Reproach and Inſults of its unkind Neighbours, and of propagating the Goſpel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Ignorant good Natur'd <hi>Indians</hi> of thoſe parts.</p>
            <p>But before our Recruits could poſſibly arrive at <hi>Caledonia,</hi> our Colony got certain Accounts of theſe Proclamations; and finding at the ſame time, the ſad Effects thereof, by being denied any the leaſt Help, either for Goods or Money, at <hi>Jamaica,</hi> from whence they had formerly Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies; And that in the Proclamation iſſued by Sir <hi>William Beſton,</hi> Governour of that Iſland, he had poſitively declared, <hi>That by their Settlement in</hi> Darien, <hi>they had actually broken the Peace entred into with His Majesties Allyes</hi> (which they believed he durſt not venture to have done without a ſufficient Warrant) And finding themſelves thereby to be of conſequence declared Pirates, without any previous Summons or Hearing, contrary to the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:46239:8"/>Cuſtoms and common Uſage of all Nations, even in the caſe of real Piracy, and founding a Belief, at the ſame time, on the Treatment which they knew our Company had formerly met with in <hi>Europe,</hi> without being Redreſs'd therein, that we were not in a Condition either to ſupply or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect them, they unhappily took the Alarm, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch a General Conſternation, as deveſted them not only of all manner of patience to ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle with any Inconveniencies they lay under at the time, but alſo of all manner of prudence, in taking any reaſonable Meaſures either for their own Security, or for our Company's intereſt. In the midſt of which Confuſion thoſe of them who had any bad Deſigns (as we could not well ſuppoſe ſuch a Number to be free of ſome) made uſe of theſe Proclamations as handles, by which to perpetrate their own ſeveral ends, and eaſily perſwaded all the reſt to leave the Settlement: Which they unadviſedly did the 20th of <hi>June</hi> laſt; And by that means not only have the Ships, Men &amp; Goods, which were there at that time, been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the Arbitrary will of thoſe to whom the Execution of thoſe Proclamations was given in Charge, but even all our ſubſequent Meaſures brought into inevitable diſorder.</p>
            <p>Upon Information of all which, we did, by our humble Petition to His Majeſty of the 19th of <hi>October</hi> 1699, in all humility and earneſtneſs, beg, <hi>That His Majeſty would in His Fatherly care for the good of our Company in particular, and of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in General, be graciouſly pleaſed to give ſpecial Teſtimonies of his Majestys Royal Protection to our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany at that Juncture, and particularly to take off the Force and effect of thoſe Proclamations which have been ſo prejudicial to us, and to ſignify his Royal pleaſure to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:46239:8"/>the Governours of his Plantations in</hi> America, <hi>that our Colony might beſupplied in the common and ordinary way of Commerce as thoſe of other Nations are; And that in the mean time His Majeſty would be graciouſly pleaſed to allow the Eſtates of Parliament to meet at the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in</hi> November <hi>laſt, or as ſoon as conveniently could be, to the end that their Advice and Aſſiſtance might be had in ſuch a weighty and General Concern.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We likewiſe, by our humble Addreſs to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's moſt Honourable Privy Council of the 20th of <hi>October</hi> 1699, Repreſented what we thought in duty and prudence neceſſary, with relation to the Contents of our ſaid Petition to his Majeſty, <hi>Humbly referring the whole to their Lordſhips moſt ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſideration, and praying that they would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to do us all the good Offices with His Majeſty that they'd think moſt expedient for ſupporting our Company and Colonys Interest; and to give him an account of our Company's hard Circumstances, and how much the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Intereſt of the Nation ſtood concern'd therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Majeſty was graciouſly pleaſed, by His Royal Letter to us of the 2d. of <hi>November</hi> 1699, to declare that. <hi>He did very much regret the Loſs which the Kingdom &amp; the Company had lately ſuſtain'd, That he would upon all occaſions protect and encourage the Trade of the Nation. That he would take care that His Subjects of this Kingdom ſhould have the ſame free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Trade and Commerce with his</hi> Engliſh <hi>Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that ever they had formerly, and that he would order the Parliament to meet, when he'd judge that the Good of the Nation would require it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, in ſome ſhort time thereafter, while we were ſolacing ourſelves with the Hopes of having His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's protection, not only as a Company eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by His Royal Authority, with the Advice and Conſent of Parliament, but alſo as Subjects, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46239:9"/>all the Preparations we could, to ſend the need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Supplies and Advices to thoſe who were laſt ſent for Repoſſeſſing the ſame Settlement: We were further aſtoniſhed to have Advices that, by ſecond Orders from <hi>England,</hi> another Fleece of Proclamations had been emitted over all the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Plantations in <hi>America,</hi> particularly on the 5th. of <hi>September</hi> laſt in <hi>Barbados,</hi> &amp;c. And that in complyance with the intent of theſe Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Our People that went along with the <hi>Riſing-Sun,</hi> were in <hi>November</hi> laſt, poſitively denyed Wood and Water at <hi>Monſerat,</hi> a Priviledge never before denyed to any other Nation: And by a Letter of the 29th. of <hi>January</hi> laſt from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of another of our Company's Ships, we are aſſured that they were poſitively denyed Ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at St. <hi>Christophers</hi> by the Governour Colonel <hi>Norton,</hi> who out of his own Mouth declared to the Commander of our ſaid Ship, That he did it by new Orders which he had received about a Month before; altho at the ſame time two <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships were then Watering there; which we have ſince confirmed to us by Letters from Mr. <hi>Daniel Mackay,</hi> one of the Councellours of our Colony, dated at <hi>Port-Royal</hi> in <hi>Jamaica</hi> the 13th. <hi>February</hi> laſt: By which Letters, he informs us likewiſe, That when he waited upon the Governour of that Iſland, concerning our Company's Ship the St. <hi>Andrew</hi> lying in that Harbour, The Governour declared to him, That tho' the ſaid Ship were fitted for going to Sea, he would not ſuffer her to go, without a ſpecial Order from <hi>England</hi> for that Effect.</p>
            <p>We likewiſe humbly beg leave to inform Your Grace, and Right Honourable Eſtates, That a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:46239:9"/>our Company's many other Loſſes and Miſ-fortunes, a Ship called the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> ladned with a valuable Cargo, belonging to our Company, ſtruck Unfortunatly on a Rock, by which ſhe ſprung a Lake, and being forc'd to run aſhoar under the Walls of <hi>Carthagena,</hi> to eſcape Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack, the ſaid Ship and Goods were by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> (His Majeſty's Allies) violently ſeized and diſpoſed of as Prize, and the Men alſo to the Number of 30 and a Boy, detain'd, and made cloſe Priſoners, not only contrary to the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, (we being then in profound Peace with them) but alſo contrary to the expreſs Terms of the 10. and 11. Articles of the Treaty concluded at <hi>Madrid</hi> the 8/18 Day of <hi>July</hi> 1670, between the Crowns of <hi>Great Brittain</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By our dutiful Addreſs of the 4th. of <hi>December</hi> 1699, we humbly Petition'd His Majeſty, <hi>That He would be graciouſly pleaſed to take theſe Proceedings of the</hi> Spaniards <hi>into His Royal Conſideration, ſo as that ſpeedy and effectual Meaſures might be taken for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of theſe Damages, and the freedom of theſe diſtreſſed Priſoners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Anſwer to which, His Majeſty was graciouſly pleaſed, by His Royal Letter of the 10th. of <hi>Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> laſt, to ſignify, <hi>That He was reſolved in the Terms of the Treaties to demand from the King of</hi> Spain, <hi>that theſe Priſoners ſhould be ſet at Liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet ſome of the moſt conſiderable of theſe Priſoners being tranſported above half a Year ago to Old <hi>Spain;</hi> We have frequent Advices from them by Letters, dated in <hi>Cadiz</hi>-Priſon, That they and all the Crew have been moſt Barbarouſly uſed, and that they themſelves are ſtill kept cloſe Priſoners, under very ſevere Treatment, Copies
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:46239:10"/>of which Letters we have ſome Months ago tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Secretaries of State.</p>
            <p>By all which, it cannot but evidently appear to Your Grace and Right Honourable Eſtates, that tho' we have all along us'd our beſt Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yours to wreſtle through theſe almoſt unſurmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Difficulties, and exerted even our utmoſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts for retrieving our Loſſes, as much as poſſible, by endeavouring to repoſſeſs and mantain ſo valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a Settlement; And tho' we have certain Advice of its being Repoſſeſs'd by our People, and that we have taken all imaginable Meaſures for their preſent Supply: Yet we have too juſt ground to be fully perſwaded, That unleſs the King and High Court of Parliament, do ſpeedily Support, Protect, and Aſſiſt us, in the Proſecution of our Company's lawful Deſigns, that all our Paſt, Preſent, and Future Endeavours muſt, to the Nations indelible Reproach and Diſhonour; as well as to its and the Company's unſpeakable and irreparable Loſs, prove unavoidably abortive.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May it therefore pleaſe Your Grace and Right Honourable Eſtates, to take the ſeveral Matters of Fact above-mentioned, into your moſt ſerious Conſideration; To Vindicat, Support, and Protect us in the Enjoyment of our lawful Priviledges, both as a Company, and as Subjects of this free and independent Kingdom, to take ſuch Meaſures, as You (in Your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Wiſdom) may judge moſt Effectual, for repairing the many Damages we have
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:46239:10"/>already ſuſtain'd, and for aſſiſting us in the further Proſecution of our Company's lawful Deſigns; but more eſpecially, for the mantainance of our juſt Right and Title to the Settlement of</hi> CALEDONIA, <hi>and the Enjoyment of ſuch Advantages as (if duly Protected) may probably ariſe thereby.</hi>
